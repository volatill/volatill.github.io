I am a Ph.D candidate at the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse), Nanyang Technological University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Siqiang Luo](https://siqiangluo.com/).
Before joining NTU, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree from the [School of the Gifted Young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/) at the University of Science and Technology of China, majoring in computer science, where I conducted research with [Prof. Yongkun Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ykli/).
Additionally, I served as an intern at [Data Systems laboratory](http://daslab.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University between 2019 and 2020, supervised by [Prof. Stratos Idreos](https://stratos.seas.harvard.edu/).

My current research interests lie in designing efficient and adaptive NoSQL databases, large-scale graph processing, and machine learning for systems.
